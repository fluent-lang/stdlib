## üëã Welcome

Welcome to the official Fluent's standard libraries repository! Here, you will find the source code of the standard libraries that come with the Fluent language.

---

## üéÜ Installation

Don't worry! Once you install Fluent, the standard libraries will be installed automatically. You don't need to do anything else.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

To create a new Fluent project, you can use the `fluent init` command. This will create a new Fluent project in the current directory.

> **NOTE:** Make sure the current directory is empty before running the `fluent init` command, otherwise, add a name after the command to create a new directory with the project name, e.g. `fluent init my_project`.

```shell
fluent init
```

You will be prompted to fill relevant information about your project like project name, author, etc.
Once you've filled in the information, the project will be created and you can start coding!

**Example structure:**

```
my_project/
    src/
        main.fluent
    Fluent.yml
    .gitignore
```
